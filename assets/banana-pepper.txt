**Hot Slice, Cold Night**

The rain beat down hard, but I didn’t mind. I liked it when the weather got nasty; it meant fewer eyes on the street and more people in bars, where they belonged. I ducked under the flickering neon sign that read “Rocco’s Pizzeria” and stepped inside, pulling off my soggy fedora. Rocco didn’t look up. He was busy slicing a pie—the kind that could make a sorcerer out of a house cat if it got enough pepper on it.

“Extra pepper,” I said as I took a stool at the counter. Rocco’s knife hesitated mid-air, but he didn’t argue. Not with me, anyway.

I was waiting for a dame—someone I knew was trouble the minute I saw her on the city blotter. Three cases of enchanted arson, two counts of illegal potion possession, and a little line at the bottom saying she was wanted in connection with the Grand Pepper Heist last month. The name was Scarlet Pepper—a name with enough fire in it to burn through a man’s sanity. My name’s Malone. I find people, find secrets, and, on occasion, get found out myself.

Rocco slid the slice over, dripping with grease and charred peppers. I took a bite, feeling the magic sizzle down my spine and hit my fingertips with a warm, electric charge. The city outside looked sharper, colors more vibrant. That’s what a good slice of pepper could do, especially in a town like this, where most people lived one slice away from total oblivion.

That’s when Scarlet walked in. She was tall, too tall for a woman with an attitude that sharp, but that’s what I liked about her. She slid onto the stool next to me like she owned the joint, and maybe she did. Rocco gave her a look that was half warning, half resignation. He knew her game as well as I did.

“Malone,” she said, lighting a clove cigarette and blowing smoke rings that smelled faintly of rosemary. “Been waiting long?”

“Long enough. Thought you’d have skipped town by now, given the heat on your tail.”

She chuckled, low and throaty, like she had secrets she’d never share. “Skip town? In a pepper drought?” She waved a manicured hand at Rocco, signaling for a slice. “Besides, I’m not through here yet.”

I watched her eat. No hesitation, no fear. She took a bite of her slice and didn’t blink as the magic hit her. Most people twitched or gasped, but she was cool as a cat in a snowstorm. I hated that I liked it.

“Word is you know something about those stolen peppers, Scarlet.”

Her eyes narrowed, but she didn’t deny it. “Maybe I do. Maybe I don’t. Word is, you’re looking for some lost magic yourself, Malone.”

I laughed, but it sounded hollow. “I’m not looking for magic, sweetheart. I’m looking for the kind of trouble only a dame like you can bring.”

She smirked, and I knew I was in deeper than I wanted to admit. “The peppers are gone, Malone. Every last one. The kind that can power an entire city for a year, stolen from under the ministry’s nose. You think it’s coincidence?”

“I think it’s suicide, but you knew that when you pulled the job.” I leaned closer, catching a whiff of her perfume—a blend of sage and vanilla. “What’s the plan? Sell ‘em to the highest bidder?”

She tilted her head, studying me with those dark, knowing eyes. “Maybe. Or maybe I’m planning something a little more... explosive.”

A warning bell rang in my head, but I kept my face neutral. “You’re playing with fire. Whoever pulled off that heist has the ministry’s top enforcers on their tail. Not to mention Lemoni’s boys.”

At the mention of Darius Lemoni—the biggest pepper tycoon in the city—her expression flickered. I’d found the nerve.

“Lemoni’s a dog with too many bones,” she muttered, looking away. “He wants the magic, fine. But he doesn’t deserve it. People are starving out there, scrounging up last-season peppers from the gutters while he sits in his high-rise casting spells for kicks.”

“So this is a charity job?” I laughed, but she wasn’t laughing.

She leaned in close, her voice a low whisper. “I’m no saint, Malone. But Lemoni’s squeezing this city dry, and he’s using the ministry to do it. Those peppers? They’re for the people who need ‘em—the ones who can’t afford to buy magic every night.”

It was a dangerous kind of talk, the kind that could get a person disappeared. But I’d seen the things Lemoni could do, the way he bent people to his will and used magic to hold the city by the throat. Maybe Scarlet was onto something.

“You’re a fool, Scarlet. But I’ve been called worse for less.” I crushed the end of her cigarette into the counter, watching the ashes smudge. “Let’s say I’m in. What’s the plan?”

She smiled, slow and satisfied, and I knew I was already done for. “Tomorrow night. Midnight. We’re hitting Lemoni’s vault. And when it’s all over, this city’s gonna light up like a fireworks show.”

I didn’t know if I’d survive the job. Didn’t know if she’d double-cross me, or if I’d be left holding the bag while she vanished into the night. But one thing was for sure: I’d be there, with my fedora pulled low and a slice of extra-pepper pizza in my gut, ready for whatever came next.

In a town like this, sometimes all you had was a hot slice and a cold night.

**Pepper Heat**

The first time Cassandra laid eyes on Dante, he was tossing a slice of banana pepper pizza into the flames with a smirk on his face. No, “tossing” wasn’t the right word—he was practically seducing the slice. She watched as he slid it onto the fire’s edge, letting the edges char and sizzle, the pepper’s smoky aroma filling the dimly lit pizzeria.

They called him “Dante the Devil” in the underground circles of the pizza magicians, and not just for his spells. The man had a reputation that spread from the Spicy Districts of the city all the way to the Ministry of Enchantment. Rumor had it he could make a pizza with so much magic it’d leave you tingling for hours—and not just in the fingertips.

Cassandra wasn’t there to ogle, though it was hard not to. She had a job. She’d been sent to retrieve a high-powered relic, hidden somewhere in Dante’s pizzeria, a relic that would grant any spellcaster threefold power if they ate a slice topped with its peppers. The Ministry wanted it locked up. But standing there, watching Dante’s dark eyes and devilish smirk, Cassandra had another idea.

She strutted to the counter, swaying her hips just enough to draw his gaze. “I hear you’ve got the hottest slice in town.”

He raised an eyebrow, letting his gaze flick down to her lips, then back up to her eyes, lingering just long enough to make her cheeks warm. “That depends on who’s ordering. Some can’t handle the heat.” He leaned forward, voice dropping. “Think you can?”

“Oh, I can handle it,” she shot back, refusing to look away. “But I’m not interested in the usual menu.” She tapped a fingertip on the counter, tracing a slow circle. “I’m here for something... special. You wouldn’t happen to have a little extra pepper for me, would you?”

His smirk deepened. “For the right person, I can make something unforgettable.” He gestured to a table tucked away in a shadowy corner. “Sit. I’ll bring it to you.”

She watched him work from the table, heart pounding as he sliced banana peppers with practiced hands, each motion full of intent. The way he handled the pizza was mesmerizing, as though each touch poured his own kind of magic into it, a spell she could feel curling around her like smoke. When he brought it over, the pizza was glowing faintly, the peppers practically radiating warmth.

“First bite’s the charm,” he said, holding her gaze. She lifted a slice, feeling the tingle of power before her teeth even touched it. The first bite sent a shock down her spine. She shivered, feeling a rush of warmth spread across her body, landing low in her belly, setting every nerve alight.

Dante watched her reaction, a slow, satisfied grin spreading across his face. “How’s the heat?”

“It’s intense,” she murmured, trying to keep her cool. But the spell’s warmth wasn’t subsiding. In fact, the heat was only building, her pulse racing faster with each heartbeat.

“You’re looking a little flushed,” he teased, leaning closer. His fingers brushed her wrist, and the contact made the magic flare, sending a shiver down her spine. “The pepper’s magic has a way of… revealing the truth,” he murmured. His eyes held hers, their heat rivaling the magic in the pizza.

“The truth?” she asked, her voice a little breathless.

“Oh, yes,” he said, his fingers moving up her arm, leaving a trail of heat. “Right now, it’s telling me you’re here for more than just a slice.”

Her breath hitched as his fingers stopped at her collarbone, tracing the line of her skin slowly, deliberately. “Maybe I am,” she said, tilting her head up, challenging him.

He chuckled, low and rough. “Then let’s see how much pepper you can handle.”

He leaned in, their lips almost touching, the air between them thick with spice and magic. The kiss came slow at first, a taste of the pepper still on her tongue as his mouth moved over hers, hungry, demanding. The magic of the pizza combined with his touch, sending warmth spiraling through her.

Their hands moved in sync, him pulling her closer, her fingers slipping into his dark curls, each touch heightening the magic’s effect. The pepper’s heat danced across her skin, electric, setting every nerve ablaze.

“Still think you can handle it?” he whispered against her neck, his breath hot and full of challenge.

She responded by pulling him closer, letting herself sink into the heat of his spell. Together, they explored the edges of magic, heat, and hunger, each kiss spicier, each touch more charged, until they were both out of breath and riding the dizzying high of magic and pepper.

By the time they broke apart, both were flushed, the spell still lingering between them, binding them in its spicy embrace.

“Consider me... enchanted,” she breathed, a sly smile on her lips.

“Oh, darling,” he whispered back, his eyes dark and full of promise. “This was just the first slice.”

**Pepper Protocol**

The smell of burnt peppers clung to the ship’s corridors, mixed with blood and charred metal. Lieutenant Vega wiped the sweat from her brow and kept her gun aimed at the hatch. Somewhere beyond it, down in the hull, the rebels were cutting through security like a pack of hyenas. They wanted the peppers—the same banana peppers the Ministry had been processing into weapons-grade energy sources since the war started.

Her radio crackled. “Lieutenant, they’re getting closer. We’ve lost all barriers to Bay Five.”

“Hold them,” she hissed, knowing it was impossible. They were outnumbered, under-equipped, and out of reinforcements. The rebels wanted control of the Pepper Protocol, the Ministry’s deadliest secret—an unstable, highly volatile source of energy that ran through every power line in the galaxy. All powered by banana peppers, harvested by prisoners in the Spicy Districts and weaponized to explosive effect. This was a pepper war, and Vega was fighting on the losing side.

The hatch hissed and cracked open, and Vega fired, hitting the first rebel right between the eyes. He dropped, blood and pepper dust spraying across the metal floor. But there were more behind him, and they stormed in, guns blazing. She ducked behind a console as bullets sparked against metal.

“Fall back to the control room!” she yelled into the radio.

Her squad scattered, running through narrow corridors while explosions rattled the ship. The rebels were brutal, outfitted in makeshift armor plastered with pepper insignias, the symbol of their rebellion against the Ministry’s grip on magical power. Vega’s pulse pounded as she took cover, firing back, her fingers slick on the trigger.

A rebel lunged at her with a knife, and she met him head-on, dodging his blade and slamming her fist into his throat. He choked, stumbling back, but another took his place, this one wielding a pepper grenade. He threw it, and the blast sent her flying against the wall, her ears ringing as bits of pepper and metal shredded her skin.

In the haze of blood and pepper dust, she felt a heavy weight hit her leg. She looked down and cursed, seeing a chunk of shrapnel lodged deep in her thigh. The pain was sharp, and blood trickled down, staining her suit.

She activated her radio. “Captain? Requesting immediate evacuation from Bay Six.”

Static answered her, then the captain’s grim voice cut through. “Evacuation denied. They’ve blocked our escape route. You’re on your own.”

She grit her teeth, yanking the shrapnel from her leg with a snarl and pressing a piece of charred fabric against the wound to staunch the bleeding. She wouldn’t die here—not in a metal tomb overrun by rebels drunk on pepper fumes and lust for power.

Gritting her teeth, she crawled toward the ship’s core, where the Protocol was stored. She punched in her override code, the door sliding open with a hiss. Inside, rows of containment units pulsed with energy, each glowing with a fierce yellow light. The smell of concentrated pepper filled the air, a smell that burned her nose and set her nerves on fire.

“Lieutenant Vega, is that you?” a voice called out. It was Corporal Reyes, clutching his rifle, eyes wild with fear.

“They’re here for the Protocol,” she said, limping over to him. “We can’t let them have it. You know what will happen if they do.”

“They’ll blow it, turn this whole system into a graveyard.” His voice trembled, but he steadied himself, holding his rifle at the ready.

The containment room door blasted open, and rebels poured in, guns raised, pepper grenades primed. Vega and Reyes fired, their shots lighting up the dim room, blood and pepper dust flying as bodies fell. But for every rebel they killed, two more took their place.

In the chaos, Vega caught sight of their leader, a hulking man with a mask of twisted pepper vines across his face. He held a glowing yellow canister—the heart of the Protocol.

“No!” she roared, charging forward. She slammed into him, knocking the canister from his grip. They grappled, each blow sending shockwaves through her battered body. She felt his knife graze her arm, slicing through her suit, blood and pepper mingling as she struggled against his weight.

He sneered at her, his voice muffled through the mask. “Your Ministry’s reign is over, Lieutenant. The people deserve power, not oppression.”

She gritted her teeth, her vision red with pain and rage. “And you’ll give it to them by turning this galaxy into ashes?”

He only laughed, pressing the knife harder against her throat. But before he could finish her, Reyes fired, the bullet hitting him square in the chest. He stumbled back, blood spilling over the pepper vines of his mask.

“Now, Vega!” Reyes shouted, tossing her a final pepper grenade.

She took it, pulling the pin and hurling it at the canister. The explosion rocked the ship, the Protocol erupting in a burst of molten pepper energy. The rebels screamed as the blast vaporized them, pepper dust and fire consuming everything.

Vega stumbled back, barely managing to activate her emergency shield as the core melted down. The walls buckled, the ship groaning as the Pepper Protocol unleashed its full fury.

Her radio crackled again, the captain’s voice cutting through the chaos. “Vega, you did it. The rebels are retreating… what’s left of them. But the Protocol… it’s gone. And so are we if we don’t get out now.”

Vega dragged herself to her feet, bloodied, battered, and covered in the acrid scent of burnt peppers and death. She activated her last beacon, feeling the hum of the evac pod as it pulled her into its embrace, the ship crumbling around her.

She didn’t know if she’d ever escape the scent of pepper dust and burning flesh, or if the galaxy would recover from this war. But for now, she was alive, and she’d saved countless lives. The Protocol was gone, and with it, a small piece of herself.

And as the pod shot her through the void, she took one last deep breath of that charred, acrid pepper scent and closed her eyes, hoping it would be her last.
