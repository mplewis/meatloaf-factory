**S17E04: “The Gang Gets Spicy”**

**COLD OPEN**

**Title card:** *“The Gang Gets Spicy”*

---

**INT. PADDY'S PUB - DAY**

*The gang is gathered around the bar, watching Dee with utter disdain as she stands on a stool in a ridiculously elaborate outfit that looks like a mix between a wizard and a chef.*

**DEE**
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... *The Pepper Queen!* (she flourishes her cape)

**DENNIS**
Dee, you look like an idiot.

**CHARLIE**
Why are you dressed like a spicy wizard?

**DEE**
First of all, it’s called Pepper Magi, Charlie. And second, I’ve acquired a *very rare pepper*—a magical banana pepper. Supposedly, it’ll give us powers. Like, real powers. *Pepper powers*.

**MAC**
(laughs) That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. Peppers don’t give powers. They just make things spicy.

**FRANK**
Yeah, but I mean... people *say* they’re magic. This guy in the alley offered me a vial of banana pepper extract for a hundred bucks. Said it’d make me invincible!

**DENNIS**
You bought drugs in an alley again, didn’t you?

**FRANK**
Maybe. But this one was legit! We should test it out.

**CUT TO: TITLE CARD**

*“The Gang Gets Addicted to Magic Peppers”*

---

**INT. PADDY'S PUB - LATER**

*The gang is gathered around a small, glowing pepper in a glass vial on the bar. They’re all staring at it intensely, as if it’s a holy artifact.*

**CHARLIE**
So... what’s the plan? Do we eat it? Snort it? Rub it on our faces?

**DENNIS**
We don’t just go for it like animals, Charlie. We need a *controlled experiment*. Observe, document, analyze.

**DEE**
Alright, I’ll be the Pepper Queen, and I’ll eat it first. (reaches for the pepper)

**MAC**
Whoa, whoa, Dee, no. You’re the bird. You’re not getting first dibs on something this powerful.

**DEE**
I’m not a bird, Mac! And besides, I actually care about my magical journey. You guys don’t respect the spice. You’re here to mooch off my destiny.

**FRANK**
(shouting) Shut up, all of you! I bought it, so I’m trying it first.

*Frank grabs the vial, chugs it, and smacks it down on the bar with a self-satisfied grin.*

**DENNIS**
(judging) You just drank that like a shot of tequila. You’re supposed to savor the flavor.

**FRANK**
Nah, it’s all good. Don’t feel a thing.

*Suddenly, Frank’s eyes go wide, his pupils dilate, and his face turns bright red.*

**FRANK**
(voice deepening) I... I can feel it. I am becoming *one with the pepper*!

**MAC**
What’s it feel like, Frank?

**FRANK**
It’s like... like I’m connected to everything. I can see... your *auras*. Dee, yours is yellow. (sniffs the air) Smells like burnt feathers.

**DEE**
You’re hallucinating, Frank. I bet you just ate a pepper laced with LSD.

**FRANK**
(ignoring her) Dennis, your aura... so dark, so hollow... (whispers) There’s nothing in there.

*Dennis is visibly disturbed by this, frowning and fixing his hair.*

**DENNIS**
Alright, that’s enough. I’m next. Hand it over.

**CHARLIE**
Wait, I wanna go. Give it to me!

**MONTAGE: THE GANG GETS SPICY**

*Charlie, Dennis, Mac, and Dee all take turns ingesting various forms of banana pepper extract, each experiencing wild hallucinations and ridiculous “powers.”*

*Charlie thinks he’s speaking fluent Italian, but he’s really just babbling nonsense to the bar’s patrons.*

*Dennis stares at himself in a mirror, convinced he’s gained telekinesis as he “moves” objects with intense looks. In reality, he’s just getting Dee to do it, who mocks him.*

*Dee is “levitating” (standing on the barstool), cackling as she “casts spells” at customers, who flee in confusion.*

*Mac takes off his shirt, flexes, and declares himself “Pepper Jesus,” convinced he has the strength of a thousand men as he tries (and fails) to lift the barstools.*

---

**INT. PADDY'S PUB - NIGHT**

*The gang is sprawled out across the floor, sweaty, exhausted, and completely burnt out.*

**CHARLIE**
(sighing) Guys... I don’t feel so powerful anymore. I feel... kinda spicy, actually. Like in a bad way.

**DEE**
Yeah, my mouth’s on fire and... (coughs) I think I just... hallucinated my teeth melting.

**DENNIS**
(angry) This pepper is defective. It didn’t give us powers—it just made us insane for a few hours!

**MAC**
Or maybe we need *more* of it. We’ve only scratched the surface.

**FRANK**
(sitting up) I got a guy. He’s got the pure stuff. *High-octane pepper powder*.

---

**EXT. BACK ALLEY - MIDNIGHT**

*The gang is huddled around a shady figure in a trench coat. He pulls out a vial filled with a sparkling, golden powder.*

**SHADY FIGURE**
You guys sure you want this? They call it the *Dragon’s Breath*. One hit, and you’ll feel like gods—or burn up like 'em.

**CHARLIE**
Yeah, yeah, we’re in. Gimme!

*The figure hands Charlie the vial, and the gang heads back into the bar, jittery with excitement.*

---

**INT. PADDY'S PUB - LATER**

*They line up the powder on the bar and each take a pinch, holding it up like they’re about to toast.*

**DENNIS**
To real power.

*They eat the powder, and within seconds, they’re hit with a surge of energy. Flames actually flicker from their mouths as they scream and writhe in pain.*

**DEE**
My face! My beautiful face! I’m *melting*!

**MAC**
(breathing fire) I’m *Pepper Jesus*! Bow before my spicy fury!

**CHARLIE**
(voice hoarse) I’m... I’m invincible!

*Charlie slams his hand down on the bar, only to recoil in pain.*

**DENNIS**
(screaming) Someone get water!

*They scramble around, knocking things over, pouring pitchers of water on each other, causing the entire pub to descend into chaos. Smoke and flames rise from the bar, setting off the sprinklers.*

---

**EXT. PADDY'S PUB - MORNING**

*The gang is outside, drenched and covered in soot. A firetruck drives away in the background.*

**DEE**
So... lesson learned. No more peppers.

**FRANK**
(holding up a new vial he found in the rubble) Except this one.
