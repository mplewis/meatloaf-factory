**Pepper Heat**

The first time Cassandra laid eyes on Dante, he was tossing a slice of banana pepper pizza into the flames with a smirk on his face. No, “tossing” wasn’t the right word—he was practically seducing the slice. She watched as he slid it onto the fire’s edge, letting the edges char and sizzle, the pepper’s smoky aroma filling the dimly lit pizzeria.

They called him “Dante the Devil” in the underground circles of the pizza magicians, and not just for his spells. The man had a reputation that spread from the Spicy Districts of the city all the way to the Ministry of Enchantment. Rumor had it he could make a pizza with so much magic it’d leave you tingling for hours—and not just in the fingertips.

Cassandra wasn’t there to ogle, though it was hard not to. She had a job. She’d been sent to retrieve a high-powered relic, hidden somewhere in Dante’s pizzeria, a relic that would grant any spellcaster threefold power if they ate a slice topped with its peppers. The Ministry wanted it locked up. But standing there, watching Dante’s dark eyes and devilish smirk, Cassandra had another idea.

She strutted to the counter, swaying her hips just enough to draw his gaze. “I hear you’ve got the hottest slice in town.”

He raised an eyebrow, letting his gaze flick down to her lips, then back up to her eyes, lingering just long enough to make her cheeks warm. “That depends on who’s ordering. Some can’t handle the heat.” He leaned forward, voice dropping. “Think you can?”

“Oh, I can handle it,” she shot back, refusing to look away. “But I’m not interested in the usual menu.” She tapped a fingertip on the counter, tracing a slow circle. “I’m here for something... special. You wouldn’t happen to have a little extra pepper for me, would you?”

His smirk deepened. “For the right person, I can make something unforgettable.” He gestured to a table tucked away in a shadowy corner. “Sit. I’ll bring it to you.”

She watched him work from the table, heart pounding as he sliced banana peppers with practiced hands, each motion full of intent. The way he handled the pizza was mesmerizing, as though each touch poured his own kind of magic into it, a spell she could feel curling around her like smoke. When he brought it over, the pizza was glowing faintly, the peppers practically radiating warmth.

“First bite’s the charm,” he said, holding her gaze. She lifted a slice, feeling the tingle of power before her teeth even touched it. The first bite sent a shock down her spine. She shivered, feeling a rush of warmth spread across her body, landing low in her belly, setting every nerve alight.

Dante watched her reaction, a slow, satisfied grin spreading across his face. “How’s the heat?”

“It’s intense,” she murmured, trying to keep her cool. But the spell’s warmth wasn’t subsiding. In fact, the heat was only building, her pulse racing faster with each heartbeat.

“You’re looking a little flushed,” he teased, leaning closer. His fingers brushed her wrist, and the contact made the magic flare, sending a shiver down her spine. “The pepper’s magic has a way of… revealing the truth,” he murmured. His eyes held hers, their heat rivaling the magic in the pizza.

“The truth?” she asked, her voice a little breathless.

“Oh, yes,” he said, his fingers moving up her arm, leaving a trail of heat. “Right now, it’s telling me you’re here for more than just a slice.”

Her breath hitched as his fingers stopped at her collarbone, tracing the line of her skin slowly, deliberately. “Maybe I am,” she said, tilting her head up, challenging him.

He chuckled, low and rough. “Then let’s see how much pepper you can handle.”

He leaned in, their lips almost touching, the air between them thick with spice and magic. The kiss came slow at first, a taste of the pepper still on her tongue as his mouth moved over hers, hungry, demanding. The magic of the pizza combined with his touch, sending warmth spiraling through her.

Their hands moved in sync, him pulling her closer, her fingers slipping into his dark curls, each touch heightening the magic’s effect. The pepper’s heat danced across her skin, electric, setting every nerve ablaze.

“Still think you can handle it?” he whispered against her neck, his breath hot and full of challenge.

She responded by pulling him closer, letting herself sink into the heat of his spell. Together, they explored the edges of magic, heat, and hunger, each kiss spicier, each touch more charged, until they were both out of breath and riding the dizzying high of magic and pepper.

By the time they broke apart, both were flushed, the spell still lingering between them, binding them in its spicy embrace.

“Consider me... enchanted,” she breathed, a sly smile on her lips.

“Oh, darling,” he whispered back, his eyes dark and full of promise. “This was just the first slice.”
