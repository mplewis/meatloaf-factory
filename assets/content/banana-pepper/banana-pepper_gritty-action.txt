**Pepper Protocol**

The smell of burnt peppers clung to the ship’s corridors, mixed with blood and charred metal. Lieutenant Vega wiped the sweat from her brow and kept her gun aimed at the hatch. Somewhere beyond it, down in the hull, the rebels were cutting through security like a pack of hyenas. They wanted the peppers—the same banana peppers the Ministry had been processing into weapons-grade energy sources since the war started.

Her radio crackled. “Lieutenant, they’re getting closer. We’ve lost all barriers to Bay Five.”

“Hold them,” she hissed, knowing it was impossible. They were outnumbered, under-equipped, and out of reinforcements. The rebels wanted control of the Pepper Protocol, the Ministry’s deadliest secret—an unstable, highly volatile source of energy that ran through every power line in the galaxy. All powered by banana peppers, harvested by prisoners in the Spicy Districts and weaponized to explosive effect. This was a pepper war, and Vega was fighting on the losing side.

The hatch hissed and cracked open, and Vega fired, hitting the first rebel right between the eyes. He dropped, blood and pepper dust spraying across the metal floor. But there were more behind him, and they stormed in, guns blazing. She ducked behind a console as bullets sparked against metal.

“Fall back to the control room!” she yelled into the radio.

Her squad scattered, running through narrow corridors while explosions rattled the ship. The rebels were brutal, outfitted in makeshift armor plastered with pepper insignias, the symbol of their rebellion against the Ministry’s grip on magical power. Vega’s pulse pounded as she took cover, firing back, her fingers slick on the trigger.

A rebel lunged at her with a knife, and she met him head-on, dodging his blade and slamming her fist into his throat. He choked, stumbling back, but another took his place, this one wielding a pepper grenade. He threw it, and the blast sent her flying against the wall, her ears ringing as bits of pepper and metal shredded her skin.

In the haze of blood and pepper dust, she felt a heavy weight hit her leg. She looked down and cursed, seeing a chunk of shrapnel lodged deep in her thigh. The pain was sharp, and blood trickled down, staining her suit.

She activated her radio. “Captain? Requesting immediate evacuation from Bay Six.”

Static answered her, then the captain’s grim voice cut through. “Evacuation denied. They’ve blocked our escape route. You’re on your own.”

She grit her teeth, yanking the shrapnel from her leg with a snarl and pressing a piece of charred fabric against the wound to staunch the bleeding. She wouldn’t die here—not in a metal tomb overrun by rebels drunk on pepper fumes and lust for power.

Gritting her teeth, she crawled toward the ship’s core, where the Protocol was stored. She punched in her override code, the door sliding open with a hiss. Inside, rows of containment units pulsed with energy, each glowing with a fierce yellow light. The smell of concentrated pepper filled the air, a smell that burned her nose and set her nerves on fire.

“Lieutenant Vega, is that you?” a voice called out. It was Corporal Reyes, clutching his rifle, eyes wild with fear.

“They’re here for the Protocol,” she said, limping over to him. “We can’t let them have it. You know what will happen if they do.”

“They’ll blow it, turn this whole system into a graveyard.” His voice trembled, but he steadied himself, holding his rifle at the ready.

The containment room door blasted open, and rebels poured in, guns raised, pepper grenades primed. Vega and Reyes fired, their shots lighting up the dim room, blood and pepper dust flying as bodies fell. But for every rebel they killed, two more took their place.

In the chaos, Vega caught sight of their leader, a hulking man with a mask of twisted pepper vines across his face. He held a glowing yellow canister—the heart of the Protocol.

“No!” she roared, charging forward. She slammed into him, knocking the canister from his grip. They grappled, each blow sending shockwaves through her battered body. She felt his knife graze her arm, slicing through her suit, blood and pepper mingling as she struggled against his weight.

He sneered at her, his voice muffled through the mask. “Your Ministry’s reign is over, Lieutenant. The people deserve power, not oppression.”

She gritted her teeth, her vision red with pain and rage. “And you’ll give it to them by turning this galaxy into ashes?”

He only laughed, pressing the knife harder against her throat. But before he could finish her, Reyes fired, the bullet hitting him square in the chest. He stumbled back, blood spilling over the pepper vines of his mask.

“Now, Vega!” Reyes shouted, tossing her a final pepper grenade.

She took it, pulling the pin and hurling it at the canister. The explosion rocked the ship, the Protocol erupting in a burst of molten pepper energy. The rebels screamed as the blast vaporized them, pepper dust and fire consuming everything.

Vega stumbled back, barely managing to activate her emergency shield as the core melted down. The walls buckled, the ship groaning as the Pepper Protocol unleashed its full fury.

Her radio crackled again, the captain’s voice cutting through the chaos. “Vega, you did it. The rebels are retreating… what’s left of them. But the Protocol… it’s gone. And so are we if we don’t get out now.”

Vega dragged herself to her feet, bloodied, battered, and covered in the acrid scent of burnt peppers and death. She activated her last beacon, feeling the hum of the evac pod as it pulled her into its embrace, the ship crumbling around her.

She didn’t know if she’d ever escape the scent of pepper dust and burning flesh, or if the galaxy would recover from this war. But for now, she was alive, and she’d saved countless lives. The Protocol was gone, and with it, a small piece of herself.

And as the pod shot her through the void, she took one last deep breath of that charred, acrid pepper scent and closed her eyes, hoping it would be her last.
