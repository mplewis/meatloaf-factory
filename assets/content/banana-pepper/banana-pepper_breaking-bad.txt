**Breaking Bad: “The Spicy Business”**

---

**INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY**

*Walt sits on the couch, scanning a newspaper headline about a rise in banana pepper consumption in Albuquerque. Skyler enters with groceries, and a suspicious look crosses Walt’s face as he scans the items.*

**WALT**
What’s with the extra peppers, Skyler?

**SKYLER**
(rolling her eyes)
They’re in season. I thought we could make that spicy salsa you love.

**WALT**
(turning serious)
Salsa, huh?

*Walt’s mind starts racing as he connects the dots between the popularity of banana peppers and the potential for a new business opportunity.*

---

**INT. SAL’S TACO STAND - DAY**

*Jesse is working the counter at a local taco joint, looking bored. He spots a shady-looking guy enter and slide a bag of banana peppers across the counter.*

**SHADY GUY**
You got any of that fire sauce? You know, the one that makes you see things?

**JESSE**
(shrugging)
Dude, I’m just a taco guy now. But I know a guy who cooks real heat.

*Jesse’s phone buzzes. It’s Walt.*

---

**EXT. WALT’S RV - DAY**

*Walt and Jesse are parked in the desert, surrounded by crates of fresh banana peppers. Walt is examining the peppers like they’re gold.*

**WALT**
This is it, Jesse. We’re going to create a new market—bananas and heat in one. We can synthesize a concentrated form of this extract.

**JESSE**
You mean... like a drug? Spicy drugs?

**WALT**
Yes! Think about it. A unique blend, something no one’s ever tasted before.

*Walt pulls out a small device resembling a lab setup.*

---

**INT. RV - LATER**

*The RV is transformed into a makeshift lab, filled with colorful liquids and sizzling pots. Walt and Jesse are cooking the banana pepper extract, and the atmosphere is intense.*

**WALT**
Be careful with that heat. This stuff is volatile.

*Jesse pours in too much extract, causing a minor explosion that fills the RV with a spicy fog.*

**JESSE**
(coughing)
Dude! This is like, too much!

---

**INT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT**

*Walt and Skyler are having dinner. Skyler is discussing finances while Walt is distracted, glancing at his phone.*

**SKYLER**
Walt, you’re not even listening. We need to discuss your health.

**WALT**
(looking up)
I’m fine, Skyler. Just focusing on the future.

*Skyler looks concerned but shrugs it off.*

---

**INT. RV - NIGHT**

*Walt and Jesse are now fully invested in their new business, having sold their first batch of banana pepper drugs. Jesse is buzzing with excitement.*

**JESSE**
This stuff is amazing, Mr. White! The kids love it!

*Walt’s face is stoic, reflecting both pride and the weight of their illegal venture.*

---

**EXT. ABQ STREETS - NIGHT**

*The streets are alive with kids excitedly buying the banana pepper drugs from various vendors, who are now popping up everywhere. A group of rival dealers watches from a distance.*

**RIVAL DEALER**
(looking at the chaos)
We need to shut this down. These idiots think they can just flood the market.

---

**INT. RV - LATER**

*Walt and Jesse celebrate their success as they count the cash, but the joy is short-lived as they hear sirens in the distance.*

**WALT**
(panicking)
Jesse, we have to move. Now!

*They scramble to pack everything up.*

---

**EXT. DESERT - NIGHT**

*The duo is on the run, parked at a remote location. Walt lights a cigarette, looking out into the distance.*

**WALT**
This isn’t just about the money anymore. They’re coming for us.

**JESSE**
What do we do?

*Walt smirks, a dangerous glint in his eye.*

**WALT**
We fight back.

---

**INT. ABQ STREETS - NIGHT**

*The rival dealers have cornered some of the banana pepper vendors. Tension fills the air as they prepare to take action.*

**RIVAL DEALER**
You think you can just take over our territory?

*A fight breaks out, spilling onto the streets. Jesse watches from a distance, unsure of what to do.*

---

**EXT. ABQ STREETS - CONTINUOUS**

*Walt arrives in the RV, yelling at Jesse to get in.*

**WALT**
Get in, Jesse! We need to show them we mean business.

*Jesse jumps in, and they rev the engine, barreling into the fray.*

---

**EXT. DESERT - NIGHT**

*Walt and Jesse emerge from the chaos, their RV battered but intact. Walt is exhilarated, while Jesse looks frightened.*

**JESSE**
What just happened, man?

**WALT**
(eyes gleaming)
We took control. This isn’t just about banana peppers anymore, Jesse. It’s about respect.

---

**INT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT**

*Walt is back home, trying to act normal. Skyler looks at him with suspicion.*

**SKYLER**
You’ve been acting strange. What’s going on?

**WALT**
Nothing. Just business as usual.

*Skyler narrows her eyes but drops it.*

---

**EXT. RV - NIGHT**

*Walt and Jesse sit in the RV, plotting their next move.*

**JESSE**
So, what’s next? More peppers?

**WALT**
(smiling)
Oh, much more than that. We’re going to revolutionize the market.

---

**FADE OUT.**
*The iconic theme plays as the screen fades to black, leaving the audience wondering what chaos lies ahead.*
