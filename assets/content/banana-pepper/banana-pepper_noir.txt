**Hot Slice, Cold Night**

The rain beat down hard, but I didn’t mind. I liked it when the weather got nasty; it meant fewer eyes on the street and more people in bars, where they belonged. I ducked under the flickering neon sign that read “Rocco’s Pizzeria” and stepped inside, pulling off my soggy fedora. Rocco didn’t look up. He was busy slicing a pie—the kind that could make a sorcerer out of a house cat if it got enough pepper on it.

“Extra pepper,” I said as I took a stool at the counter. Rocco’s knife hesitated mid-air, but he didn’t argue. Not with me, anyway.

I was waiting for a dame—someone I knew was trouble the minute I saw her on the city blotter. Three cases of enchanted arson, two counts of illegal potion possession, and a little line at the bottom saying she was wanted in connection with the Grand Pepper Heist last month. The name was Scarlet Pepper—a name with enough fire in it to burn through a man’s sanity. My name’s Malone. I find people, find secrets, and, on occasion, get found out myself.

Rocco slid the slice over, dripping with grease and charred peppers. I took a bite, feeling the magic sizzle down my spine and hit my fingertips with a warm, electric charge. The city outside looked sharper, colors more vibrant. That’s what a good slice of pepper could do, especially in a town like this, where most people lived one slice away from total oblivion.

That’s when Scarlet walked in. She was tall, too tall for a woman with an attitude that sharp, but that’s what I liked about her. She slid onto the stool next to me like she owned the joint, and maybe she did. Rocco gave her a look that was half warning, half resignation. He knew her game as well as I did.

“Malone,” she said, lighting a clove cigarette and blowing smoke rings that smelled faintly of rosemary. “Been waiting long?”

“Long enough. Thought you’d have skipped town by now, given the heat on your tail.”

She chuckled, low and throaty, like she had secrets she’d never share. “Skip town? In a pepper drought?” She waved a manicured hand at Rocco, signaling for a slice. “Besides, I’m not through here yet.”

I watched her eat. No hesitation, no fear. She took a bite of her slice and didn’t blink as the magic hit her. Most people twitched or gasped, but she was cool as a cat in a snowstorm. I hated that I liked it.

“Word is you know something about those stolen peppers, Scarlet.”

Her eyes narrowed, but she didn’t deny it. “Maybe I do. Maybe I don’t. Word is, you’re looking for some lost magic yourself, Malone.”

I laughed, but it sounded hollow. “I’m not looking for magic, sweetheart. I’m looking for the kind of trouble only a dame like you can bring.”

She smirked, and I knew I was in deeper than I wanted to admit. “The peppers are gone, Malone. Every last one. The kind that can power an entire city for a year, stolen from under the ministry’s nose. You think it’s coincidence?”

“I think it’s suicide, but you knew that when you pulled the job.” I leaned closer, catching a whiff of her perfume—a blend of sage and vanilla. “What’s the plan? Sell ‘em to the highest bidder?”

She tilted her head, studying me with those dark, knowing eyes. “Maybe. Or maybe I’m planning something a little more... explosive.”

A warning bell rang in my head, but I kept my face neutral. “You’re playing with fire. Whoever pulled off that heist has the ministry’s top enforcers on their tail. Not to mention Lemoni’s boys.”

At the mention of Darius Lemoni—the biggest pepper tycoon in the city—her expression flickered. I’d found the nerve.

“Lemoni’s a dog with too many bones,” she muttered, looking away. “He wants the magic, fine. But he doesn’t deserve it. People are starving out there, scrounging up last-season peppers from the gutters while he sits in his high-rise casting spells for kicks.”

“So this is a charity job?” I laughed, but she wasn’t laughing.

She leaned in close, her voice a low whisper. “I’m no saint, Malone. But Lemoni’s squeezing this city dry, and he’s using the ministry to do it. Those peppers? They’re for the people who need ‘em—the ones who can’t afford to buy magic every night.”

It was a dangerous kind of talk, the kind that could get a person disappeared. But I’d seen the things Lemoni could do, the way he bent people to his will and used magic to hold the city by the throat. Maybe Scarlet was onto something.

“You’re a fool, Scarlet. But I’ve been called worse for less.” I crushed the end of her cigarette into the counter, watching the ashes smudge. “Let’s say I’m in. What’s the plan?”

She smiled, slow and satisfied, and I knew I was already done for. “Tomorrow night. Midnight. We’re hitting Lemoni’s vault. And when it’s all over, this city’s gonna light up like a fireworks show.”

I didn’t know if I’d survive the job. Didn’t know if she’d double-cross me, or if I’d be left holding the bag while she vanished into the night. But one thing was for sure: I’d be there, with my fedora pulled low and a slice of extra-pepper pizza in my gut, ready for whatever came next.

In a town like this, sometimes all you had was a hot slice and a cold night.
